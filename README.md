## ðŸš§   Project Description  

The Digital Sobriety Escape Game is an educational experience designed to raise awareness about responsible digital usage. Divided into two rooms, the game challenges players to navigate through scenarios where they make deliberate mistakes in the first room, reflecting common digital pitfalls. Upon entering the second room, players must correct these mistakes to progress, emphasizing learning from errors.Here my contribution In addition to the game conception aspect of the Escape Game was to implement an AI-powered chatbot integrated to assist players throughout the game. The chatbot offers both text-based commands and voice interaction capabilities using OpenAI's GPT-3.5, enhancing immersion and engagement. This project aims to promote digital literacy and encourage thoughtful digital behavior through interactive gameplay

## ðŸ”¨   Methodology for prompt construction

### Use case analysis
I conducted a comprehensive analysis of potential interaction scenarios where players could benefit from the AI assistant. This involved identifying critical points such as navigating through game puzzles, correcting common digital errors, and promoting good digital practices.

### Prompt formulation
Following OpenAI's prompt engineering guidelines, I crafted initial queries and responses designed to foster natural and immersive conversation. Each prompt was  designed to align  with the game's educational objectives, ensuring meaningful interactions with players.

### Iteration and Optimization
Through iterative cycles informed by user testing feedback, I refined the prompts to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the assistant's responses. This process also focused on simplifying and clarifying instructions provided by the assistant, facilitating intuitive player guidance.

### Validation and Deployment
Prior to the final deployment, a  validation phase was undertaken to assess the reliability and effectiveness of the assistant across various game scenarios. This validation ensured that the assistant effectively contributed to an interactive and educational player experience.


## ðŸ”‘   Features

- **Textual AI Assistant**: An integrated AI chatbot designed to assist players throughout the game using text-based commands. Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for natural and interactive responses. Additionally, employs Text to Speech functionality to provide spoken feedback and instructions directly within the game interface.
  
- **Vocal AI Assistant**: Allows players to interact with the AI assistant using voice commands, providing an immersive experience where players can engage by speaking directly to the game. Integration includes both Text to Speech and Speech to Text functionalities, enabling seamless communication and feedback through spoken dialogue.

- **Image recognition AI Assistant**: Allows players to interact in an immersive way with the game by using real-time captured images. This facilitates puzzle solving and enigma resolution, enabling participants to scan objects, decode symbols, or capture visual clues that can be instantly analyzed by the chatbot.

## ðŸ”§   Tools employed

- **Streamlit**: Framework used for building the interactive web application.
  
- **OpenAI**: Utilized for natural language processing (NLP) tasks including chatbot interactions, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech functionalities.

- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the application

## ðŸ“„    Usage

- Choose between text-based or voice-based assistance on the Streamlit sidebar.
- Navigate through the game's rooms and solve puzzles in any order.
- Interact with the AI assistant to receive hints and guidance in solving puzzles.
