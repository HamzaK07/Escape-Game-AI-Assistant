## 🚧   Project Description  

The Digital Sobriety Escape Game is an educational experience designed to raise awareness about responsible digital usage. Divided into two rooms, the game challenges players to navigate through scenarios where they make deliberate mistakes in the first room, reflecting common digital pitfalls. Upon entering the second room, players must correct these mistakes to progress, emphasizing learning from errors.Here my contribution In addition to the game conception aspect of the Escape Game was to implement an AI-powered chatbot integrated to assist players throughout the game. The chatbot offers both text-based commands and voice interaction capabilities using OpenAI's GPT-3.5, enhancing immersion and engagement. This project aims to promote digital literacy and encourage thoughtful digital behavior through interactive gameplay

## Features

- **Textual AI Assistant**: An integrated AI chatbot designed to assist players throughout the game using text-based commands. Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for natural and interactive responses. Additionally, employs Text to Speech functionality to provide spoken feedback and instructions directly within the game interface.
  
-**Vocal AI Assistant**: Allows players to interact with the AI assistant using voice commands, providing an immersive experience where players can engage by speaking directly to the game. Integration includes both Text to Speech and Speech to Text functionalities, enabling seamless communication and feedback through spoken dialogue.


## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Framework used for building the interactive web application.
  
- **OpenAI**: Utilized for natural language processing (NLP) tasks including chatbot interactions, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech functionalities.

- **Python**: Programming language used for backend logic and integration with Streamlit and OpenAI APIs.
